# Meals-app

This _Meal_ web app is a project made to showcase the use of The TheMealDB API. It was my first hands on fully React personal app since I worked with it in other work projects but nothing I can show at in my personal portfolio. This wiki-ish app was made using all the power that React can bring, I'll describe in the next lines the technologies I use.

## features & libraries

This is a full frontend app made with react so I was bound to use some of the tools crafted for specific purposes, I wanted this to be as simple as possible in terms of libraries added and what brings to the table. I needed to manage the global state, make API requests, other than that I just wanted it to make it pretty. Here's the list:

- **Vite**: Ineeded a nice and easy dev environment, hot reload and commodity.
- **React Router**: Self explanatory.
- **React Icons**: Nice and centralized place to get multiple Icons.
- **TailwindCSS**: I find it easier to style my components if I do it by myself.
